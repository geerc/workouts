# XC and Track Workouts (Christian Geer)

This repository is a compilation of all of the workouts that I have completed as a Divisison III runner at Allegheny College. The goal of this repository is to be able compare each workout against all the other workouts of the same type (such all tempo runs), showing the progress that I have made as a runner.
